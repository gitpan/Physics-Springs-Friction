Physics::Springs::Friction version 1.00
=======================================

Physics::Springs::Friction adds friction forces to particle simulations
as performed by Physics::Springs.

This module adds functionality to the Physics::Springs and Physics::Particles
modules. As with Physics::Springs, you use() Physics::Springs::Friction
instead of the underlying module, but any functionality of the underlying
modules (Physics::Particles, Physics::Springs) is retained.

As of version 1.00, Physics::Springs::Friction is no longer compatible to
versions earlier than 1.00. Furthermore, it is no longer compatible to
versions below 1.00 of Physics::Springs and Physics::Particles.

Current versions of this module may be found at http://steffen-mueller.net/
or on CPAN.
